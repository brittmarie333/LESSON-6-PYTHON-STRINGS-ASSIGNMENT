#Task 3: Review Summary
#Implement a script that takes the first 30 characters of a review and appends "â€¦" to create a summary. 
# Ensure that the summary does not cut off in the middle of a word.
#Example: "This product is really good. I'm...",

script = ("This product is really good. I'm impressed with its quality. The performance of this product is excellent. Highly recommended! I had a bad experience with this product. It didn't meet my expectations."_
